# OpenHellion server
The OpenHellion server is the part of the project that clients connect to to play the game. These manage the game state, and interact with clients to update that state.

When the server starts it connects to the main server and announces it has been started. This adds a listing on the main server that will be used by clients find a server to connect to.

For more information about servers take a look at the [documentation](https://openhellion.github.io/documentation/server-overview) on the website.
